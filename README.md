Introducing WordLink, a kid-friendly word game that will not only teach students new words but, make the classroom a more enjoyable experience. When we think of entertainment, the first thing that comes to mind is a video game. Not all video games are enriching and provide students with learning experiences, so we decided we wanted to make a game inspired by Wordle but with a twist. Then, we remembered the family game we all grew up playing, “Word Chain.” It is a game where family members decide on a category and start with a word following that theme. The next player would have to name a word that follows the theme while it starts with the last letter of the previous word. Now designed with AI, WordLink is now available online and is your solution to endless entertainment while stimulating your brain. Whether you're seeking to learn vocabulary, have fun, or take a break, our platform has it all. Thank you ABC Code Jam for the opportunity! -Anish Rangarajan, Pranav Anamarlu, and Suryaa Ram
